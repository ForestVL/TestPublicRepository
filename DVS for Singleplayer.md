Dialogue Verse System is a free system of Verse devices, materials and documentation to easily create dialogues for your characters in your UEFN experiences!

> [!WARNING] WARNING
> This version of DVS only works in Singleplayer because of the nature of how PopUp Dialog Device works. There is a possible solution on how to make it work in Multiplayer but I need more time to test and implement it

> [!INFO]- NEEDS ESSENTIALS VERSE MODULE v0.1 OR HIGHER
> Verse code in this project uses Essentials Verse Module with handy commands like `StrToMsg()` or `SmartStrToArray()`. You can install Essentials with DVS together down below or separately if needed

Here's everything you need to start. Have fun!
